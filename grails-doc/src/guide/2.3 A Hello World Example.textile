To implement the typical "hello world!" example run the "create-controller":ref/Command%20Line/create-controller.html command:

bc.
grails create-controller hello  

This will create a new controller (Refer to the section on Controllers for more information) in the @grails-app/controllers@ directory called @HelloController.groovy@.

Controllers are capable of dealing with web requests and to fulfil the "hello world!" use case our implementation needs to look like the following:

bc.
class HelloController {
	def world = {
		render "Hello World!"
	}
}                           

Job done. Now start-up the container with another new command called "run-app":ref/Command%20Line/run-app.html:

bc.
grails run-app

This will start-up a server on port 8080 and you should now be able to access your application with the URL: @http://localhost:8080/helloworld@

The result will look something like the below:

!img/intropage.png(Grails Intro Page)!

This is the Grails intro page which is rendered by the @web-app/index.gsp@ file. You will note it has a detected the presence of your controller and clicking on the link to our controller we can see the text "Hello World!" printed to the browser window.
