The previous example configuration assumes you want the same config for all environments: production, test, development etc.

Grails' DataSource definition is "environment aware", however, so you can do:

{code}
dataSource {
	// common setting here
}                     
environments {
  production {
     dataSource {
          url = "jdbc:mysql://liveip.com/liveDb"					
     }			
  }
}    
{code}
