GSP also supports a few JSP-style page directives. For example the @import@ directive:

{code:xml}
<%@ page import="java.awt.*" %> 
{code}

The @import@ directive allows you to import classes into the page. However, it is rarely needed due to Groovy's default imports and [GSP Tags|guide:tags].

GSP also supports the @contentType@ directive:

{code:xml}
<%@ page contentType="text/json" %> 
{code}

The @contentType@ directive allows using GSP to render other formats.
