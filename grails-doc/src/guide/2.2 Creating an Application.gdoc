To create a Grails application you first need to familiarize yourself with the usage of the @grails@ command which is used in the following manner:

bc.
grails [command name]

In this case the command you need to execute is [create-app|commandLine]:

bc.
grails create-app helloworld

This will create a new directory inside the current one that contains the project. You should now navigate to this directory in terminal:

bc.
cd helloworld
