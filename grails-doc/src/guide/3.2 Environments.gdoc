h4. Per Environment Configuration

Grails supports the concept of per environment configuration. Both the @Config.groovy@ file and the @DataSource.groovy@ file within the @grails-app/conf@ directory can take advantage of per environment configuration using the syntax provided by "ConfigSlurper":http://groovy.codehaus.org/ConfigSlurper. As an example consider the following default @DataSource@ definition provided by Grails:

{code:java}
dataSource {
    pooled = false                          
    driverClassName = "org.hsqldb.jdbcDriver"	
    username = "sa"
    password = ""				
}
environments {
    development {
        dataSource {
            dbCreate = "create-drop" // one of 'create', 'createeate-drop','update'
            url = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:devDB"
        }
    }   
    test {
        dataSource {
            dbCreate = "update"
            url = "jdbc:hsqldb:mem:testDb"
        }
    }   
    production {
        dataSource {
            dbCreate = "update"
            url = "jdbc:hsqldb:file:prodDb;shutdown=true"
        }
    }
}
{code}

Notice how the common configuration is provided at the top level and then an @environments@ block specifies per environment settings for the @dbCreate@ and @url@ properties of the @DataSource@. This syntax can also be used within @Config.groovy@.

h4. Packaging and Running for Different Environments

Grails' [command line|guide:commandLine] has built in capabilities to execute any command within the context of a specific environment. The format is:

{code:java}
grails [environment] [command name]
{code}

In addition, there are 3 preset environments known to Grails: @dev@, @prod@, and @test@ for @development@, @production@ and @test@. For example to create a WAR for the @test@ environment you could do:

{code:java}
grails test war
{code}

If you have other environments that you need to target you can pass a @grails.env@ variable to any command:

{code:java}
grails -Dgrails.env=UAT run-app
{code}

h4. Programmatic Environment Detection

Within your code, such as in a Gant script or a bootstrap class you can detect the environment using the [Environment|api:grails.util.Environment] class:

{code:java}
import grails.util.Environment

...

switch(Environment.current) {
	case Environment.DEVELOPMENT:
	   configureForDevelopment()
	break
	case Environment.PRODUCTION:
	   configureForProduction()
	break 
}
{code}
