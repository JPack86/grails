In GSP the @<%= %>@ syntax introduced earlier is rarely used due to the support for GSP expressions. It is present mainly to allow ASP and JSP developers to feel at home using GSP. A GSP expression is similar to a JSP EL expression or a Groovy GString and takes the form @${expr}@:

{code:xml}
<html>
  <body>
    Hello ${params.name}
  </body>
</html>
{code}

However, unlike JSP EL you can have any Groovy expression within the @${..}@ parenthesis.
