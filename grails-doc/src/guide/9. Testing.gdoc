Automated testing is seen as a key part of Grails, implemented using [Groovy Tests|http://groovy.codehaus.org/Testing+Guide]. Hence, Grails provides many ways to making testing easier from low level unit testing to high level functional tests. This section details the different capabilities that Grails offers in terms of testing.

The first thing to be aware of is that all of the @create-*@ commands actually end up creating @integration@ tests automatically for you. For example say you run the [create-controller|commandLine] command as follows:

{code:java}
grails create-controller simple
{code}

Not only will Grails create a controller at @grails-app/controllers/SimpleController.groovy@, but also an integration test at @test/integration/SimpleControllerTests.groovy@. What Grails won't do however is populate the logic inside the test! That is left up to you.

h4. Running Tests

Test are run with the [test-app|commandLine] command:

{code:java}
grails test-app
{code}

The above command will produce output such as:

{code:java}
-------------------------------------------------------
Running Unit Tests...
Running test FooTests...FAILURE
Unit Tests Completed in 464ms ...
-------------------------------------------------------

Tests failed: 0 errors, 1 failures
{code}

Whilst reports will have been written out the @target/test-reports@ directory. 

h5. Targeting Tests

You can selectively target the test(s) to be run in different ways. To run all tests for a controller named @SimpleController@ you would run:

{code}
grails test-app SimpleController
{code}

This will run any tests for the class named @SimpleController@. Wildcards can be used...

{code}
grails test-app *Controller
{code}

This will test all classes ending in @Controller@. Package names can optionally be specified...

{code}
grails test-app some.org.*Controller
{code}

or to run all tests in a package...

{code}
grails test-app some.org.*
{code}

or to run all tests in a package including subpackages...

{code}
grails test-app some.org.**
{code}

You can also target particular test methods...

{code}
grails test-app SimpleController.testLogin
{code}

This will run the @testLogin@ test in the @SimpleController@ tests. You can specify as many patterns in combination as you like...

{code}
grails test-app some.org.* SimpleController.testLogin BookController
{code}
