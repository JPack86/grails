Since many Java EE containers typically supply @DataSource@ instances via the "Java Naming and Directory Interface":http://java.sun.com/products/jndi/ (JNDI). Sometimes you are required to look-up a @DataSource@ via JNDI. 

Grails supports the definition of JNDI data sources as follows:

{code:java}
dataSource {
    jndiName = "java:comp/env/myDataSource"
}
{code}

The format on the JNDI name may vary from container to container, but the way you define the @DataSource@ remains the same.
