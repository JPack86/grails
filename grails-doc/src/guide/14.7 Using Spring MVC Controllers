Since Grails is built on Spring MVC, you can use normal Spring MVC mechanics to implement controllers if you so choose. A Spring MVC controller can be written in Java or Groovy and need to use Spring MVC annotations. For example:

{code}
package foo

import org.springframework.stereotype.*
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*

@Controller
class SpringController {

	@RequestMapping("/test.dispatch")
	void handleRequest() {
		println "Hello from Spring MVC"
	}

}
{code}

In this case the URI @/test.dispatch@ will be mapped to the above Spring MVC controller. If you want a nicer URI you can use URL mappings to re-write the URI:

{code}
"/pretty"(uri:'/test.dispatch')
{code}

The Spring @View@ to use is determined based on conventions. So in the above case a view called @grails-app/views/test.gsp@ will be rendered. The view can also be a JSP rather than a GSP.
