h4. IntelliJ IDEA

Currently by far the most mature and comprehensive Groovy & Grails IDE is [IntelliJ IDEA 7.0|http://www.jetbrains.com/idea] and the [JetGroovy|http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/GRVY/Groovy+Home] plug-in. The Grails team recommends IDEA over other IDE environments for large projects.

h4. TextMate

Since Grails' focus is on simplicity it is often possible to utilize more simple editors and "TextMate":http://macromates.com/ on the Mac has an excellent Groovy/Grails bundle available from the [Texmate bundles SVN|http://wiki.macromates.com/Main/SubversionCheckout].

h4. Eclipse

For "Eclipse":http://www.eclipse.org/ there is also the "Groovy Eclipse Plugin":http://groovy.codehaus.org/Eclipse+Plugin that offers syntax highlighting, code completion and so on. 

{note}
There are some quirks with the Groovy Eclipse plug-in which are [covered in detail|http://grails.org/Eclipse+IDE+Integration] on the Grails wiki.
{note}

Grails automatically creates Eclipse @.project@ and @classpath@ files for you, so to import a Grails project just right-click in the "Package Explorer" and select "Import" then "Existing project into Workspace" and "Browse" to the location of your project.

Then immediately click "Ok" followed by "Finish" and your project will be set-up.

Grails will also automatically set-up an appropriate Eclipse "Run Configuration", that can be accessed from the "Run" menu in Eclipse.
