For general configuration Grails provides a file called @grails-app/conf/Config.groovy@. This file uses Groovy's "ConfigSlurper":http://groovy.codehaus.org/ConfigSlurper which is very similar to Java properties files except it is pure Groovy hence you can re-use variables and use proper Java types!

You can add your own configuration in here, for example:

{code}
foo.bar.hello = "world"
{code}

Then later in your application you can access these settings in one of two ways. The most common is via the [GrailsApplication|api:org.codehaus.groovy.grails.commons.GrailsApplication] object, which is available as a variable in controllers and tag libraries:

{code}
assert "world" == grailsApplication.config.foo.bar.hello
{code}
