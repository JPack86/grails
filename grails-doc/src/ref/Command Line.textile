h1. Command Line Usage

Grails incorporates the powerful build system "Gant":http://groovy.codehaus.org/Gant, which is a Groovy wrapper around "Apache Ant":http://ant.apache.org.                

The basic usage scenario is:

bc.
grails [environment]* [command name]

Grails will search for Gant scripts that match the given name in the following locations:

* USER_HOME/.grails/scripts
* PROJECT_HOME/scripts
* PROJECT_HOME/plugins/*/scripts
* GRAILS_HOME/scripts

If Grails discovers multiple commands matching the name entered it will offer you a choice as to which one to execute.

The Gant script itself consists of a number of targets typically taking the following form:

bc.
target(compile:"The compile task") {
	// code
}          
target(default:"The default task") {
	depends(compile)
	// code
}

Grails will execute the "default" target when calling Gant scripts. 

h2. Profiling the command line

Grails has built in profiling within the command line tools which can help in debugging. To enable command line profiling use:

bc.
grails -Dgrails.script.profile=true run-app
