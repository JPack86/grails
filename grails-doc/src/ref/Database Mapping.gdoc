h1. Database Mapping Usage

Domain classes in Grails by default dictate the way they are mapped to the database using sensible defaults. You can customize these with the ORM Mapping DSL. For example create a @Book@ domain:

{code:java}
grails create-domain-class Book
{code}

And then you can use the @mapping@ block to customize the ORM mapping behavior.

{code:java}
class Book {
	String title
	Date releaseDate
	Author author
	
	static mapping = {
		table "books"
		author column:"auth_id"
	}
}
{code}
