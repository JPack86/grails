h2. Purpose

The _create-plugin_ command will create a Grails plug-in project. A Grails plug-in project is just like a regular Grails project except it contains a plug-in descriptor and can be packaged up as a plug-in and installed into other applications.

Plug-ins are not just useful for plug-in developers, but also as a way to modularize large Grails applications. Refer to section "x. Plug-in Development":../../index.html in the user guide for more information on developing plug-ins for Grails.
